# Family Budget App

This project is a simple mobile budget tracking application developed as a **learning project** using **Expo and React Native**.

The main goal of this project was not to build a production-ready application, but to **understand the process of mobile app development**, including:
- defining a clear goal,
- breaking the solution into logical steps,
- working with project structure and basic components,
- and iteratively improving functionality.

During development, **AI tools were used as a learning aid**, similar to documentation or tutorials.  
AI was used to support understanding, suggest approaches, and explain concepts — **not as a replacement for independent thinking or decision-making**.  
All implementation choices were guided by a clear understanding of what the application should do and how individual parts fit together.

This project reflects an **early-stage learning experience** and an interest in mobile development, problem-solving, and modern development tools.  
It represents a practical step in building foundational skills that will be further developed through formal study.
